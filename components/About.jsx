            I have spent the last 4 years in the university where i graduated with a bachelor's degree in 
            physics, I have always had a knack for
            technology, working with computers and learning new things. At the start of 2021 I started reading articles on programming and what aspects i could eventually go into,
            before i started learning HTML and CSS as my first step towards becoming a Front-end web developer. What i thought was just a few small edits turned into  a love for programming
           
          </p>
          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started learning javascript and was even more
            enthused with making websites interactive.I then fully dived into becoming a web developer, and went further to learn technologies like
            React JS, Next Js, Firebase, while learning new technologies. And now i spend most of my time trying to build projects with those frameworks.
